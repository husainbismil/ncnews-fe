              <div className="article-fw-fixedheader-votebuttons">
          <span>vote buttons</span>
        </div>
              
    REMAINING TODOES:
              
              make tooltip text for the article list, so when you hover over '2 years ago' you get the full timestamp like how it is on reddit. 
              
              change upvote icon color from blue to orange or sain

              complete hamburger menu so a lightbox fades in or a slider slides in from right like in react-hamburger

              make the divs in the view All Articles page able to dynamically resize. right now some divs have a height that is too large. when time, do some experimenting with css to fix this.
